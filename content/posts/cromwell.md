To a Cromwell's Army Captain.

_Last two verses._


Oh captain, all these battles are in vain  
Vain the endeavor, the striving and yet the gain  
Of man, who lasts, at most, less than a day  
All will be happen and still in the past laid.  

The iron which will wound you is lost and growing rust  
You are as doomed as much the rest of us.
